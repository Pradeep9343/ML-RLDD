Rice leaf disease detection involves using machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify and identify common diseases affecting rice leaves. The process typically includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to achieve accurate and reliable disease diagnosis, even under varying image conditions.
